# LibriMem-frontend

## Notes

1. We use _.test.tsx for RTL unit tests and _.spec.tsx for cypress integration tests.

2. The integration tests are components tests of cypress that are located next to each page file.

3. Josemagne changed the client facing term "E-Mail" with "Username". The variable name is still email and we save it still as "email".

## TODO

- Amend point 3. of Notes
