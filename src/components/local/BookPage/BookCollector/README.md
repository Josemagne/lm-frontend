# BookCollector

BookCollector is a component that groups together books. BookCollector is in the page BookPage ("/books").

BookCollector uses react-beautiful-dnd for larger screen sizes beginning from 768px and a simple listing below that.

BookCollector uses BookFilter to search for certain books that the user wants to add to a group.
