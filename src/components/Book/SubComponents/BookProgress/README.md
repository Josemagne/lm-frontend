# BookProgress

The BookProgress component is a progress bar that shows how much progress the user has made with a book.

## How is the progress calculated?

The progress is the result of many variables.
A book is divided into chapters. Therefore we can divide the 100% by the amount of chapters to read or the pages to read.
The user can decide in the settings or at the beginning of the program when a chapter is finished. The user could for example say that he only completes a chapter when he has written the summary and given his opinion on it.
