# Glossary

Here is a listing of the words that I use extensively in LibreMem and what I want to convey with them.

## Words

### comprehend

Often it does not suffice to simply "read" a book. Often you have to "interact" with the chapter. You have to force your brain to repeat what you just read and "elaborate" on it. You can do this for example with a summary or by creating flashcards.

The word << comprehend >> comes from the Latin and means to fully cover something. This meaning is appropriate. As a baby we learn to cover the things with our hands and our mouth and thereby our brain understands the essence of the object we are confronting.
